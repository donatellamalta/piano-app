This is a piano web app created with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript to have fun with your smartphone. The project is realized with the idea and graphic design realized by Boolean trough the Boolean coding week to which I participated. 

At each key, the corresponding sound is associated though Javascript and some visual movements are applied with CSS to simulate finger pressure.
